# Hi there 👋, i see you've been employed to work on flaury_mobile so lets dive into the code structure !

## Application Structure
After a successful build, your application structure should look like this:
```
.
├── android                         - It contains files required to run the application on an Android platform.
├── assets                          - It contains all images and fonts of your application.
├── ios                             - It contains files required to run the application on an iOS platform.
├── lib                             - The most important folder in the application, used to write most of the Dart code.
    ├── main.dart                   - Starting point of the application
    ├── app
    |   ├── customer                - It contains the customer  features . basically all the view associated with the customers. 
            | ├── authentication    - It contains the customer authentication views and controllers. so you add another feature, it views and controllers and scale up ass the app grows
